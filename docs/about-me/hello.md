## About me

Hello, my name is Steph. I am a UX Designer & Engineer who is passionate about design systems, open source projects, and building beautiful & functional products.

I have a rescue named Chico. He is a two-year-old grey and white terrier mix who is sweet, smart, and very curious. Chico is huge advocate of me leaving my desk to take him for long walks and to feed him treats.
