## About me

Hello, my name is Steph.

I am a UX Designer & Engineer with a strong interest in Design Systems and open source projects.

I have a rescue dog named Chico who previously lived in Mexico. He is a two-year-old grey and white terrier mix who is sweet, smart, and very observant. He is a huge advocate of me leaving my desk to take him for long walks and to feed him treats.
