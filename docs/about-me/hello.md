## About me

Hello, my name is Steph. I am a UX Designer & Engineer who is passionate about design systems, open source projects, and building beautiful & functional products.

This is Chico, my rescue from Mexico. He is a two-year-old grey and white terrier mix who is sweet, smart, and mischievous. Chico is huge advocate of me leaving my desk to take him for long walks and to feed him treats.
