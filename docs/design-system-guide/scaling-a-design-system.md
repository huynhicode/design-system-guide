## Some strategies to consider when scaling a design system

- Introducing variations: add new features to an existing component.
- Enabling change: make modifications to the design systems for things that are not working as expected.
- Designing across brands: find the commonality between brands to create themes that serve functional uses.
- Designing across platforms: "create a technology-specific flavor of the design system" (e.g. React to build applications).
- Design Tokens: update the visual values of design tokens.
