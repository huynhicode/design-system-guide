## Some strategies for scaling a design system

- Introducing variations: adding new features to an existing component.
- Enabling change: making modifications to the design systems for things that are not working as expected.
- Designing across brands: finding the commonality between brands to create themes that serve functional uses.
- Designing across platforms: "creating a technology-specific flavor of the design system" (e.g. React to build applications).
- Design Tokens: updating the visual values of design tokens.
