A design system only serves a purpose if it is used. Things to consider when maintaining a design system:

- Who is the design system for?
- How will the design system be used?
- How can the design system be adapted?
- How can people contribute to it?

## Some strategies for maintaining a design system

- Include knowledge about the design system as part of the onboarding process for new employees.
- Encourage and incentivize active contribution to the design system.
- Host regular Q&A sessions and workshops; conduct surveys for feedback and input.
- Treat the design system as a living system so that it can grow and evolve.

## Other considerations

- Make the design system:
  - Official: allocate time and money.
  - Adaptable: count on change and have a plan for it.
  - Maintainable: easy to communicate changes.
  - Cross-disciplinary: involve the organization.
  - Approachable: easy to use and understand.
  - Visible: communicate, collaborate, and evangelize.
  - Bigger: include brand, writing, and code guidelines.
  - Agnostic: naming conventions based on structure.
  - Contextual: demonstrate patterns and usage.
  - Lasting: start with a solid foundation.
