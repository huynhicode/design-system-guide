### What is a design system?

A design system is a set of standards that serves as the single source of truth to guide in the development of products within a brand's umbrella. It is composed of a collection of reusable components that can be used to build interfaces and interactions.

### What makes up a design system?

- Design Language: a set of standards that serves as the single source of truth to guide in the development of products within a brand's umbrella.
- Component Library: reusable components that can be used to build interfaces and interactions.
- Style Guide: the design system documentation - includes context & instructions.

### What are some considerations of a design system?

- Accessibility: able to be used by everyone regardless of circumstance.
- Flexibility: be able to serve to a variety of use cases.

### What are some benefits of a design system?

- Consistency: the same look and feel across the board as part of a brand's identity.
- Scalability: a streamlined and sustainable workflow.
- Efficiency: decreases the time it takes to build and ship products.

### How to start building out a design system?

- Conduct a visual audit: take an inventory of all the components that make up your product(s).
- Create a visual design language: this is made up of four main categories.
  - Color
  - Typography
  - Sizing and spacing
  - Imagery
- Create a UI/pattern library (e.g. button, form, modal, etc).
- Start documenting each component: what each component is and how to use each one.
