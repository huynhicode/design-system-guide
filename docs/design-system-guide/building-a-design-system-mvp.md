## What to capture in a design system

Foundational building blocks:

- Colors
- Typography
- Icons
- Layout

Reusable components that are made from foundational building blocks:

- Buttons
- Cards
- Data
- Inputs
- Navigation
- Overlays
- Templates

## What to capture in a design system MVP

- All foundation building blocks
- Three reusable components (it's recommended to start with buttons)

## How to quickly start a design system MVP

- Use components from a brand redesign or a new product version.
- Use the more complex component with the more demanding use case when deciding between two components that are similar.
- Use components from an open source library.
- Aim for iteration and not perfection.

Some open source libraries to explore:
  - [Google's Material](https://material.io/design)
  - [GitHub's Primer](https://primer.style/)
  - [Microsoft's Fluent](https://www.microsoft.com/design/fluent/#/)
  - Open source design systems on [Figma Community](https://www.designsystems.com/open-design-systems/)
