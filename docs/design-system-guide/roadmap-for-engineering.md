## Creating a design system roadmap - engineering

- Select a few components to build: choose components that are more commonly used (e.g. buttons).
- Decide between a component library or custom component library: start with a component library or create one from scratch.
- Framework: choose a framework for the component library (e.g. React, Angular, Vue, etc.).
- Distribution: how will the component code be shared (e.g. NPM).
- Development lifecycle: what is the process from build to release.

## Examples of React component libraries

- [MUI](https://mui.com/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/)
- [Semantic UI](https://semantic-ui.com/)
